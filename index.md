**Hello!** Welcome to my page! I am a third year computer science engineering major at UCSD and have experience in Java, C, and C++. 
I like to game (SMITE, League of Legends, Genshin Impact, etc), watch anime and movies, and draw ~~though I am not that good at it.~~
> I often have no idea what I am doing.
